                              <P>located at the eastern end of the Bai Causeway, Broken Bridge gives a open sight due to its high terrain and therefore is one of the best places for snow viewing. Visitors can also view the bridge from Baoshi mountain -- a mountain close to the bridge. When the bridge is covered by the snow and as the sun come up, the snow on the arched midlle part of the bridge will melt, leaving the two ends still covered. When visitors see the bridge at this time from Baoshi Mountain down, the bridge looks as if it is broken, and thay is how the bridge got its name.      
                                <p>Even when there is no snow, the bridge still looks pretty. As one of the moust famous tourist hot spots among West Lake area, it is always crowded with visitors.</p>

                              <p>The original pagoda was built in 975 AD at the order of King Qian Chu (born Qian Hongchu) of Wuyue to celebrate the birth of his son during Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was an octagonal, five-storey structure built of brick and wood and with a base built out of bricks. During the Ming dynasty, it was burned by Japanese pirates, leaving only the brick skeleton, as can be seen from Ming paintings of the West Lake.  Later, due to a rumor that the bricks from the tower could repel illness, many people started stealing bricks from the tower. Finally on a afternoon of 1924, the pagoda collapsed. The Hangzhou government decided to rebuild the pagoda in 1999 and it reopened in 2002</p>
                              <p>Not only has a rich history, the pagoda also looks especially beautiful when surrounded by the golden hues of the setting sun.</P>

              <p>To prevent the famous lake from degrading into a swamp, Su Shi had it dredged and the sediment pulled from the lake formed into Su Causeway, made up of small islands connected by bridges that crosses the entire lake from north to south, to allow locals another means of enjoying the lake. Sunrise reveals the serene scene of Dawn Over Su Causeway in Spring that inspired painters and poets alike, with the trees planted along the causeway in full spring bloom, swaying in the wind.</p>

              <h2>Lotus in the Breeze at Crooked Courtyard</h2>
              <img src="img/qu.jpg" />
              <p>The imperial family of the Southern Song Dynasty kept their imperial brewery, Quyuan, close to the banks of West Lake in their capital city, Hangzhou. When the gentle summer breeze blew through lotuses kept in the lake near the brewery, it mixed with the smells of alcohol and was said to make even those not drinking feel intoxicated.</p>
              <p>Whether or not this economical drunkenness was more poetry than fact will have to be left to the imagination—the brewery went in to disrepair and by Kangxi's time the Scent of the Quyuan Brewery and Lotuses on the Wind was long gone. Kangxi had a pavilion and stelae erected on the lake's northwest side to represent the scene. Lotuses still bloom in the park located on the spot today near the Mausoleum of Yue Fei, BYOB.</p>

              <aside><img src="img/ping.jpg" /></aside>
              <p>Traditionally, viewing the autumn moon over West Lake was a sight without a designated spot. Locals and travelers took to boats—small ones and large pleasure boats alike—to admire the autumn moon. Kangxi, however, ordered a pavilion built to mark the spot for viewing the moon on Solitary Hill (Gu Shan) at the western end of the Bai Causeway (Bái Dī, 白堤). The neon lights lining the eaves of the two-story pavilion were probably not what Kangxi had in mind, but their reflection in the water is there to serenely hypnotize even when the Autumn Moon Over the Calm Lake is not.</p>

              <P>In keeping with the seasonal theme, Lingering Snow on Broken Bridge takes in the view from the arched Broken Bridge, located at the eastern end of the Bai Causeway, the day after snow has fallen. To the northwest, the view takes in the snow-covered buildings and hill at Gu Shan while the rest of the lake stretches out in black contrast to the south, with the snowy white hills around it.</P>
              <p>The Broken Bridge is also said to be the meeting place of two star-crossed lovers from the Ming-era story "Account of Three Pagodas at West Lake" about the love between a young man and a young woman, who was actually a white snake, making this a popular spot for those in love.</p>

              <p>The rather poetically named Listening to Orioles Among the Billowing Willows, also translated as Orioles Singing in the Willows, was once the Southern Song Imperial Gardens. It's a park perfect for strolling along the cobblestone walkways watching as orioles weave through willow-shaded gardens. The park can be found on the lake's east bank beside Nanshan Road north of Hefang Street.    </p>

              <p>Once part of the private garden of a Southern Song government official, Flower Harbor on the lake's southwestern side blooms throughout the spring and summer. Today, Watching the Fish at Flower Harbor happens at the garden's Red Carp Pond where fish crowding to the surface to snap up food is reflected on busy days by tourists crowding the waters edge hoping to snap a picture. The spot was a particular favorite of Emperor Qianlong, who wrote a poem about it.</p>

              <img src="img/lei.jpg" />
              <P>While the name is traditionally written as "evening glow" (夕照), Kangxi changed the name in his list to "western glow" (西照)—both with the same pronunciation. The Glow of Sunset Upon Leifeng Pagoda (Léifēng Xīzhào, 雷峰夕照) creates a silhouette said to resemble a gentleman (the pagoda) beside a reclining lady (the hill). For many, there's more to the story than just the scene, though.</P>
              <p>While Leifeng Pagoda was built in 975 on the orders of the ruler of the Wuyue Kingdom, it was later tied to the aforementioned love story—after the two fall in love, a Daoist exorcist discovers the woman's secret that she's actually a white snake and has her buried beneath the pagoda (the two other women in her family are likewise disguised animals who are placed beneath two other pagodas). Luckily for our mythical white snake lady, the pagoda on top of her collapsed in the 1920's after locals stole too many of the bricks from the base of the already-dilapidated pagoda. The current structure was built with an elevator inside to get guests to the top, but thankfully it doesn't ruin the silhouette.</p>

              <img src="img/san.jpg" />
              <p>During his time as prefect of Hangzhou, Su Shi also built three small stupas on the lake as boundary markers. These have also been said to be the pagodas referenced in the Ming-era story of the white snake and the boy that loved her. While they were also included in the list the Ten Scenes of West Lake by the 13th century, the corruption of a Buddhist monastery located on a nearby islet prompted one city official to order the pagodas and monastery destroyed more than 200 years later. Today, three new stupas have taken their place as the Three Pools Reflecting the Moon (Sāntán Yìnyuè, 三潭印月). They're iconic enough to be on the back of the RMB 1 note and they can be reached by boat.</p>
